## üìã **EFFICIENT WORKFLOW PROCESS**

### **STEP 1: PREPARE ZIP FILE**
\`\`\`
Create ZIP with this structure:
saferoute-ai-strategy.zip
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CLAUDE-BRIEFING-MASTER-PACKAGE.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MASTER-SAFEROUTE-CONSOLIDATION.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 01-strategic-framework/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 02-business-development/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 03-grant-applications/
\`\`\`

### **STEP 2: GRANT-SPECIFIC CLAUDE CONVERSATIONS**

**For Each Grant Application:**
1. **Upload ZIP file** to Claude
2. **Use specific prompt template** (see above)
3. **Reference 2-4 key files** (not all files)
4. **Request professional formatting** ready for submission
5. **Iterate if needed** with additional file references

### **STEP 3: QUALITY CONTROL**
- **Review against grant requirements** from GRANT-PROGRAMS-DETAILED-BREAKDOWN.md
- **Check Indigenous sensitivity** using INDIGENOUS-FIRST-STRATEGY.md
- **Verify technical accuracy** against CLAUDE-BRIEFING-MASTER-PACKAGE.md
- **Ensure completeness** using DOCUMENT-BACKUP-CHECKLIST.md
