## üöÄ **EFFICIENT CLAUDE WORKFLOW**

### **STEP 1: PREPARE MODULAR BRIEFINGS**
Create 4-5 focused briefing documents instead of one massive file:

1. **CORE-BRIEFING.md** (1,700 words) - Always include
2. **TECHNICAL-MODULE.md** (800 words) - For R&D grants
3. **CLIMATE-MODULE.md** (800 words) - For sustainability grants
4. **INDIGENOUS-MODULE.md** (800 words) - For Indigenous-focused grants
5. **BUSINESS-MODULE.md** (800 words) - For commercialization grants

### **STEP 2: GRANT-SPECIFIC COMBINATIONS**
**Total per conversation: ~2,500 words (well within Claude limits)**

**For NRC IRAP:**
- Core Briefing + Technical Module = 2,500 words

**For SDTC:**
- Core Briefing + Climate Module = 2,500 words

**For Indigenous Services Canada:**
- Core Briefing + Indigenous Module = 2,500 words

**For BC Tech:**
- Core Briefing + Business Module = 2,500 words

### **STEP 3: CLAUDE CONVERSATION STRATEGY**
**Single Conversation Per Grant Application:**

\`\`\`
Prompt Template:
"Create a complete, submission-ready [GRANT NAME] application using this briefing:

[PASTE CORE BRIEFING + RELEVANT MODULE]

Requirements:
- Professional formatting ready for submission
- Grant-specific customization for [PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS]
- Include all required sections: Executive Summary, Technical Description, Market Analysis, Financial Projections, Implementation Timeline
