## üí° **BOTTOM LINE**

**We have an EXCELLENT strategic foundation, but we're missing the tactical execution components needed to:**
- Start development (wireframes, product specs)
- Raise investment (pitch deck, financials)
- Apply for major grants (business plan)
- Execute go-to-market (GTM strategy, customer acquisition)

**RECOMMENDATION: Let's build the missing components systematically, starting with the development-critical items (wireframes, product specs) this week, then the business-critical items (business plan, pitch deck) next week.**
