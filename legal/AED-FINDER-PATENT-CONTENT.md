    this.updateLocalCache(report)
  }
}
\`\`\`

### Integration with Hero Network™

The AED Finder™ seamlessly integrates with the broader Hero Network™ system:

**Hero Network Alert System:**
When no AEDs are found, the system can alert trained community volunteers:

\`\`\`typescript
class HeroNetworkIntegration {
  alertVolunteersWithAEDs(location: Coordinates): Promise<HeroAlert> {
    const nearbyHeroes = await this.findNearbyTrainedVolunteers(location, {
      skills: ['aed_trained', 'cpr_certified'],
      maxDistance: 2000, // 2km radius
      availability: 'available'
    })

    const alert: HeroAlert = {
      type: 'aed_needed',
      location: location,
      urgency: 'high',
      requiredSkills: ['aed_operation'],
      estimatedResponseTime: this.calculateResponseTimes(nearbyHeroes)
    }

    return this.dispatchHeroAlert(alert)
  }
}
