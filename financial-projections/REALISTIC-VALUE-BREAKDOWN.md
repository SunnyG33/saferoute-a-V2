## üìä **VALUATION METHODOLOGY**

### **How Company Valuations Work:**
\`\`\`
Company Value = Annual Revenue √ó Industry Multiple

Emergency/Health Tech Multiples:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Early Stage (Year 1-2): 2-4x revenue
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Growth Stage (Year 3-4): 4-8x revenue
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Mature Stage (Year 5+): 6-12x revenue
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Strategic Acquisition: 8-15x revenue
\`\`\`

### **Your Personal Value Calculation:**
\`\`\`
Personal Value = Company Valuation √ó Your Ownership %

Ownership Dilution Over Time:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Start: 100% ownership
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ After Grants: 90-95% (minimal dilution)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ After Seed Round: 60-70% ownership
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ After Series A: 40-50% ownership
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ After Series B: 25-35% ownership

## üéØ **REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS**

### **Most Likely Outcome (If You Execute Well):**
- **Year 1 Annual Revenue**: $225K
- **Year 2 Annual Revenue**: $650K
- **Year 3 Annual Revenue**: $2M
- **Company Valuation at Exit**: $1.5M - $3M
- **Your Personal Payout**: $1M - $2M

### **What This Means:**
- You won't be making millions per year in revenue
- But the company could be worth $1M-2M total after 2-3 years
- Your personal payout would be $1M-2M when you sell/exit
- This assumes you execute well and hit your targets

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **REALITY CHECK**

### **The $1M-2M I Mentioned Is:**
- ‚úÖ **Total company value** (what someone would pay to buy the whole company)
- ‚úÖ **Your personal payout** if you sell your shares
- ‚ùå **NOT annual revenue** (that would be much lower)
- ‚ùå **NOT guaranteed** (requires excellent execution)

### **Annual Revenue Reality:**
- Year 1: $225K (if everything goes well)
- Year 2: $650K (with good growth)
- Year 3: $2M (if you scale successfully)

### **Personal Income Reality:**
- Years 1-2: Minimal salary, reinvest everything
- Year 3: Maybe $100K-150K salary
- Exit payout: $1M-2M total (not per year)

---

## üí° **BOTTOM LINE**

**The $1M-2M potential value is:**
- **Total company worth** after 2-3 years of good execution
- **Your one-time payout** when you sell or exit
- **NOT annual income** - that would be much lower

**Realistic annual revenue progression:**
- Year 1: $225K
- Year 2: $650K  
- Year 3: $2M
- Years 4-5: $5M-10M (if everything goes perfectly)

**Your personal financial outcome:**
- Salary during building: $50K-150K annually
- Exit payout: $1M-2M total (one-time payment)
- Timeline: 2-3 years of hard work to reach exit

This is still excellent for a startup, but it's important to have realistic expectations about the timeline and what the numbers actually represent.
